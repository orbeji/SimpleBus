<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project provides a simple implementation of the **Command Bus** and **Query Bus** patterns, tailored for **Spring Boot** applications. It enables the decoupling of commands and queries from their handling logic, promoting cleaner architecture, better separation of concerns, and improved scalability.

## Features

- **Command Bus and Query Bus**:
  - Separate buses for handling **commands** (write operations) and **queries** (read operations), ensuring clear responsibility boundaries.

- **Spring Boot Integration**:
  - Designed to work seamlessly with Spring Boot, leveraging its dependency injection and configuration capabilities.

- **Decoupled Architecture**:
  - Commands and queries are fully decoupled from their handlers, making the system more modular and maintainable.

- **Extensibility**:
  - Supports adding custom middlewares for logging, validation, or other cross-cutting concerns, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to project needs.

- **Scalable**:
  - Easily add new commands or queries without affecting existing functionality, allowing the system to grow with minimal friction.

## Use Cases

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**:
  - Ideal for applications implementing the **CQRS** pattern, separating write and read models effectively.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
  - Can be used in event-driven systems where commands trigger events or messages that are handled asynchronously.

- **Enterprise Applications**:
  - Suitable for large, complex systems that require a clean separation of business logic and application layers.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To integrate the Command and Query Bus into your Spring Boot application:

### 1. Importing the project
**TODO**

### 2. Implementing a Command
A command represents an action or a request for changing the state of the application. For example, creating a new user.

#### Create the Command:

```java
import cat.bernado.simplebus.command.Command;

public class CreateUserCommand implements Command {
    private String username;
    private String email;

    public CreateUserCommand(String username, String email) {
        this.username = username;
        this.email = email;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```
#### Create the Command Handler:
The handler contains the logic that will be executed when the command is dispatched.

```java
import cat.bernado.simplebus.command.CommandHandler;

@Service
public class CreateUserCommandHandler implements CommandHandler<CreateUserCommand> {

    @Override
    public void handle(CreateUserCommand command) {
        // Business logic for creating a user
        System.out.println("User created: " + command.getUsername() + " with email: " + command.getEmail());
    }
}
```
### 3. Dispatching a Command
   You can dispatch a command using the Command Bus. This is typically done in a service or controller.

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UserController {

    private final CommandBus commandBus;

    public UserController(CommandBus commandBus) {
        this.commandBus = commandBus;
    }

    @PostMapping("/create-user")
    public void createUser() {
        CreateUserCommand command = new CreateUserCommand("username", "email@example.es");
        commandBus.dispatch(command);
    }
}
```

### 4. Creating a Middleware
   Middlewares allow you to add extra logic, such as logging, validation, or metrics, to the command and query handling process.

**Example: Logging Middleware**
Create a middleware that logs commands before they are handled.

```java
@Component
public class LoggingMiddleware<M extends Message, R> implements Middleware<M, R> {

  private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggingMiddleware.class);

  @Override
  public R execute(M message, Function<M, R> next) {
    logger.info(String.format("Received %s", message.getClass().getName()), message);
    try {
      //Important! pass the execution to the next layer
      R result = next.apply(message);
      logger.info("Command handled successfully");
      return result;
    } catch(Exception ex) {
      logger.error(String.format("Exception while handling %s", message.getClass().getName()), ex);
      throw ex;
    }
  }
}
```
### 5. Configuring the Middleware
   To load middlewares into the command or query bus, configure them in your Spring Boot project.

**Example: LoggingMiddleware Configuration**
```java
@Configuration
public class MiddlewareConfig {

    @Bean
    public <M extends Message, R> List<Middleware<M, R>> middlewares(LoggingMiddleware<M, R> loggingMiddleware) {
        return Collections.singletonList(loggingMiddleware);
    }
}
```
You can create more middlewares for various purposes, such as:

* **Validation Middleware**: Validate commands or queries before they are handled.
* **Authorization Middleware**: Ensure the user has the right permissions before executing a command.
* **Exception Handling Middleware**: Capture and handle exceptions globally in your command or query bus.
Simply implement the Middleware interface and register them in the configuration as shown above.
